# PAMC Dhamma Books

The `main` branch is the authoritative source for the current Dhamma Books website.

## Shared PCED files

- `pced-lookup-core.js` — exact and verified-form resolver
- `pced-standard-data.js` — maintained inflections, aliases, compounds, and sandhi
- `pced-approved-terms.js` — approved Chinese-Tipiṭaka terminology snapshot
- `pced-popup-standard.js` — cross-book popup display, reset, and movement behavior

PCED-enabled books use the Daily-Chants standard:

1. Approved Chinese-Tipiṭaka entry, when precisely matched
2. Chinese PCED entries
3. English
4. Burmese
5. Other correctly identified languages

Popups reopen at the beginning and remain movable within the visible screen. Prefix, substring, and fuzzy dictionary fallbacks are not allowed.

See `PCED-LOOKUP-UPDATE-REPORT.md` for rollout details and tests.

## Shared reader controls and screen header — 7 September 2026

Every current and future reader book must load `dhamma-books-reader-standard.css` and `dhamma-books-reader-standard.js`.

The shared contract provides:

- **Book Mark:** one header button and one modal supporting add, list, go and delete, stored separately for each book in the browser.
- **Search:** searches the active visible reading text, filters native reading blocks, highlights all matches, moves to the first match, reports no results, and restores the pre-search display and position when cleared.
- **Screen header:** background `#A8734F`, white text, system UI font, 18 px desktop title / 16 px mobile title, and 14 px desktop controls / 12 px mobile controls.

Book-specific content, body typography, language switching, PCED language profiles, dictionary/terminology data and AI behavior remain outside this shared standard.

### Header language and layout correction

The shared controls use English, Chinese or Burmese according to the active reading language, including bookmark-modal actions and search feedback. Bilingual books update these labels when the reading language changes. At normal desktop width, controls stay on the main header row; mobile may wrap. The previous shared header palette is retained: `#A8734F` with white text and translucent-white controls.
