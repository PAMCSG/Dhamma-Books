# PCED Lookup Update Report

Date: 2 September 2026  
Shared core: `pced-lookup-core.js` version 1.0.0

## Result

All 13 Dhamma Books HTML readers that provide Roman-script Pāli word lookup now load the shared PCED core.

- Newly connected to the shared core: 10 readers.
- Already connected and retained: 3 Pāli Chanting Book readers.
- Exact clicked forms remain first.
- Approved aliases, related forms, and book-specific compound mappings remain available.
- Runtime inflection candidates are accepted only when the complete proposed headword exists in the PCED subset embedded in that book.
- Pāli spelling normalization includes NFC/lowercase handling and approved equivalents such as `ṁ` → `ṃ`, `aa` → `ā`, `ii` → `ī`, and `uu` → `ū`.
- No arbitrary prefix, suffix-fragment, or substring entry is accepted as a dictionary headword.
